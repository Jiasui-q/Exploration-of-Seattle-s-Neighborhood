  Introduction
  
  Seattle has always been viewed as a famous city with its unique culture and history. Coffee, movies, big businesses, 
  stunning views of nature, and other features of this city have attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors to come. 
  Every year during March and April, people flock to Seattle to take a look at the gorgeous cherry-blossom at the University
  of Washington. Not just during spring, according to new data released at Visit Seattle's Annual Meeting, the city and county
  have welcomed a record of 40.9 million visitors last year in 2018. With a growing number of visitors each year, Seattle is 
  becoming more and more popular. 

  For a visitor who comes to Seattle for the first time, itâ€™s good to know what places worth visiting the most. Information
  about local stores and their ratings would largely help people to schedule wisely and make better traveling plans. Visitors
  can, therefore, be more prepared before coming to visit. My exploration starts from cities near Seattle to venues within
  Seattle and near the University of Washington. 
  

  Data Description
  
  1) I first explored cities in Washington state according to unique postal codes. Data is collected from the GeoNames 
     geographical database. I scraped and cleaned the web page to get information about postal codes, city names, their 
     corresponding latitudes and longitudes.
  2) I used the geocoding library to get the center coordinates of Seattle, University of Washington, and the University 
     Village.
  3) Nearby venues of given locations, as well as ratings of venues, are all extracted from Foursquare API.
